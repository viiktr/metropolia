/*Create a Java-program that asks the userâ€™s first name, last name and age.
The program must combine the first and last name to a single variable so that the value of the variable is both
names divided with a space. After this the program prints the name and age of the user.
Hint:The + operator can be used to combine the names.
Program is written to a class called AskName.

Example output:
Type in your last name: Matt
Type in your first name: Jackson
Type in your age: 15
You are Jackson Matt and your age is 15 years.*/

import java.util.Scanner;

public class AskName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Type in your last name: ");
        String surname = reader.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Type in your first name: ");
