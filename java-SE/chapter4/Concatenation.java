/*Your task is to complete the program below by defining five variables (first, second, third, fourth and fifth).
Find out which variables are int type and which are String type from the example print.
You need to find out the values used to initialize the variables in the example print.
Write only the missing statements in the text box.
Program to complete:

public class Concatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Place your code here

        System.out.println(first + fourth + (second + third) + fifth
             + ":Finland was the world champion in ice hockey.");

        System.out.println(first + "" + (first + third) + (first - 1) + fourth
             + ": Finland went under Russian rule.");

        System.out.println(first + fifth + fifth + (first - 1)
             + ": Helsinki was founded.");
    }
}

Example output:
1995:Finland was the world champion in ice hockey.
1809: Finland went under Russian rule.
1550: Helsinki was founded. */
