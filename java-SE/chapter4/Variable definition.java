/*Your task is to define the required variables and initialize them with values that will match the print with the shown example.
You only need to write the variable definitions and initializations in the text box.
Hint: Check the example print for correct values for variables.
Program to complete:

public class Variables {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        // Your own code here
        String end = "and here is the end";
        String fullText = start + end;

        System.out.println("Value of the integer variable is: " + integer);
        System.out.println("Value of the character variable is: " + character);
        System.out.println("Value of the character string variable is: " + string);
        System.out.println("Value of the concatenated character string is: " + fullText);
        System.out.println("Value of the truth variable is: " + truth);
    }
}

Example output:
Value of the integer variable is: -25
Value of the character variable is: M
Value of the character string variable is: This is going great!
Value of the concatenated character string is: This is the start of the text and here is the end
Value of the truth variable is: true */

String start=("This is the start of the text ");
String end=("and here is the end");
        int integer=-25;
        String character=("M");
        String string=("This is going great!");
        String truth=("TRUE");
